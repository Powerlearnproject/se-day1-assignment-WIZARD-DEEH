Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-this is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development of and maintenance of high quality software systems.
-it helps in creation of software apllication and systems used on daily life activities like communication, commerce , education and also healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages- here they developed languages like Fortran and C
Dstablishment of software engineering- they established it as a principle in the 1960s 
The rise of of agile methodologies in the 2000s- this became one of the used methodologies 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements- there is information gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design- there is creation of detailed design of the software architecture and user interface.
Immplementation- this is the writing the code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing- after building the code, you test if it is working and if it meets the quality standards.
Deployment- Releasing the software to users or customers
Maintenance- providing support,updates of the system.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is the sequential approach with a distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall example from system requirements, system design down to system maintenance while Agile methodologies is the interative approach with focuses on flexibilty ,collaboration and responding to change.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- responsible for writing codes and implementing the software solutions needed.
Quality Assurance Engineer- ensures the software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager- they oversee the planning, execution and delivery of software projects


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code and they include Visual studio, Eclipse.
Version Control Systems (VCS) it is a software tool used for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members and they include Git and Subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements- one can dopt an agile approach which is one of common ways to handle changing requirements.
Tight deadlines- one can prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance and do them in steps to allow good work flow.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing- this is testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration testing- this is testing integrations between different components or subsystems.
System testing- this is testing the entire system as one.
Acceptance testing- this is testing software against user requirements to ensure it meets the user needs or specifications


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing or crafting questions or staments to get the best possible responses from AI models.
Prompt engineering helps in making the questions clear and more specific for the Ai to understand exactly what one needs.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vogue prompt-"Write something about man"
improved prompt- "write an essay about the evolution of early humans"
this will give the specific information about early man unlike the first one which was giving a general question and could give any information about man.
